# User Stories

Reference the Writing User Stories final project guide in the course portal for more information about how to complete each of the sections below.

## Outline User Roles

1. Job Seeker: A user who is actively applying for jobs and using JobDash to organize and track their job applications, monitor progress, and manage deadlines and follow-ups.

## Draft User Stories

1. As a user, I want to log my job applications, so that I can keep track of all the positions I have applied for in one place.

2. As a user, I want to view a timeline of my job applications, so that I can visually see the progression and current status of each application.

3. As a user, I want to set reminders for follow-up actions, such as sending a thank-you email or scheduling a follow-up call, so that I stay proactive in my job search.

4. As a user, I want to update the status of my job applications (e.g., interview, offer, rejection), so that I can monitor the outcomes of my job search efforts.

5. As a user, I want to receive notifications for key dates, such as interview schedules and application deadlines, so that I never miss important events.

6. As a user, I want to filter and sort my applications by job title, company, or status, so that I can easily focus on specific opportunities or track progress in different categories.

7. As a user, I want to view analytics about my job search, such as how many jobs I've applied for, how many interviews I've had, and my success rate, so that I can measure my progress and refine my strategy.

8. As a user, I want to add notes to each job application (e.g., interview feedback or next steps), so that I can keep track of important details related to each opportunity.

9. As a user, I want to export my job application data to a CSV file, so that I can share it with my career advisor or keep a personal backup.

10. As a user, I want to sync my calendar with JobDash, so that interview dates and follow-up reminders automatically appear on my personal calendar.
