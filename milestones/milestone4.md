## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

In this unit, the team successfully made significant progress on the core functionalities of our project. We were able to implement key features like handling note creation, editing, and deletion, which are central to the user experience. Additionally, we made improvements to the UI, ensuring that it is more user-friendly and responsive. Communication among the team was efficient, and we were able to resolve issues quickly, ensuring that we stayed on track with our sprint goals.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

 We had issues with the times not reflecting the correct local time or not updating as expected when changes were made. Additionally, there were some integration issues when pulling in the latest changes from the backend, which caused conflicts that needed manual resolution. Another challenge was balancing time between addressing bugs and working on new features for the project.

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

Yes, we managed to complete the tasks in our sprint plan for this week. The main tasks that were completed include implementing note functionalities, integrating analytics, and filtering applications.

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

The features that may be at risk are related to real-time updates and the timestamp functionality. Since we are still working through some issues with correct time zone handling and displaying accurate timestamps, we will prioritize this to avoid any inconsistencies in the app’s behavior. If this issue remains at risk, we might need to scale back on the additional features and focus on ensuring the core functionalities are solid before adding new features.

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

In the upcoming units, additional support in debugging and resolving any backend-related issues would be helpful. We may need assistance in integrating some more complex features, such as implementing notifications or real-time updates, which could require advanced knowledge in WebSockets or other technologies. Additionally, more testing resources would be beneficial to ensure that our app performs well under different conditions and is robust across various use cases.
