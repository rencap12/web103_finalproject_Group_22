## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

We successfully implemented the job application tracking dashboard. The collaboration between team members was particularly strong, with each of us contributing effectively to different components of the project. We've made efficient use of our chosen tech stack, and the project structure has remained well-organized, with clearly defined features and user stories guiding our development process.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

Coordinating development tasks across team members required careful planning and communication to ensure smooth integration of different components. 

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

While we've made substantial progress on the tracking dashboard, some planned features still require additional development time. Our current focus has been on establishing the fundamental functionality that makes JobDash valuable to users. Looking at our remaining tasks, we're prioritizing them based on user impact: first ensuring robust core functionality for application tracking and status updates, then implementing essential user experience features like filtering tools, and finally developing more advanced features such as comprehensive analytics. 

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

The Timeline of Applications feature, while valuable, demands careful UI design consideration to effectively display temporal data. Since this would be displayed on the tracking dashboard, we need to ensure independence of the dashboard and timeline functionality. If the functionalities for both become too interconnected, we will reorganize and structure their interactions.

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

Code review support for our more complex features would ensure we're following best practices and maintaining code quality. We could also use advice on optimal state management strategies across components, particularly for handling multiple job application states.
