## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

Our group successfully identified the necessary database components for the features of JobDash, such as the job application tracking dashboard, analytics, and event scheduling, and managed to outline the database structure effectively. We also divided responsibilities, which helped us work more efficiently.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

 Mapping out the ER diagram for our database was also challenging as we wanted to ensure scalability and accuracy in data handling. 
 
### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

We may need more guidance on optimizing back-end queries to improve application performance and support with advanced React.js techniques for the UI. Learning more about security best practices for user authentication and data privacy would also be helpful as we move closer to deploying the project.
