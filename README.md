### Description and Purpose

JobDash is a comprehensive web app designed to help job seekers organize and track their job applications in one convenient location. Users can log job listings they've applied to, including details like company name, job title, date of application, job status (e.g., interview, offer, rejection), and key dates such as interview schedules and deadlines. With an intuitive interface, JobDash provides a visual timeline of applications, reminders for follow-ups, and analytics to help users understand their job-seeking progress over time.
