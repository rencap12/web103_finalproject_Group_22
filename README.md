## About

### Description and Purpose

JobDash is a comprehensive web app designed to help job seekers organize and track their job applications in one convenient location. Users can log job listings they've applied to, including details like company name, job title, date of application, job status (e.g., interview, offer, rejection), and key dates such as interview schedules and deadlines. With an intuitive interface, JobDash provides a visual timeline of applications, reminders for follow-ups, and analytics to help users understand their job-seeking progress over time.

### Inspiration

The inspiration for JobDash came from the challenges many job seekers face when managing multiple job applications. The process of applying to jobs, tracking deadlines, and following up can quickly become overwhelming. JobDash was created to simplify this by providing an organized, all-in-one solution that helps users stay on top of their applications and take control of their job search journey with ease and confidence.
